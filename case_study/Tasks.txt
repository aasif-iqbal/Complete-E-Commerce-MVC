1.http://localhost/salt/cart
# In Cart, if two white shirts of different size and color is added 
  then, on deleting one shirt , all others shirt also deleted.

=> solution: product have same product_uuid, also check card_id or create unique id for each card items.

=========================

// Assume you have already established a MySQL connection
$json_string = '[{"user_uuid":"988f64b4-bc4a-11ed-bb06-98460a99789a","product_uuid":"c6b04c52-c256-11ed-bf9a-98460a99789a","product_name":"White T-Shirt","product_image":"0_4.jpg","product_quantity":"2","product_size_name":"M","product_color_name":"Yellow","product_selling_price":"1"}]';

// Decode the JSON string to a PHP array
$cart_items = json_decode($json_string, true);

// Loop through the array to process each cart item
foreach ($cart_items as $item) {
    $user_uuid = $item['user_uuid'];
    $product_uuid = $item['product_uuid'];
    $product_name = $item['product_name'];
    $product_image = $item['product_image'];
    $product_quantity = $item['product_quantity'];
    $product_size_name = $item['product_size_name'];
    $product_color_name = $item['product_color_name'];
    $product_selling_price = $item['product_selling_price'];

    // Process the cart item as needed
    // For example, you can insert it into a MySQL database:
    $query = "INSERT INTO cart_items (user_uuid, product_uuid, product_name, product_image, product_quantity, product_size_name, product_color_name, product_selling_price) VALUES ('$user_uuid', '$product_uuid', '$product_name', '$product_image', '$product_quantity', '$product_size_name', '$product_color_name', '$product_selling_price')";
    $result = mysqli_query($connection, $query);

    if (!$result) {
        echo "Error: " . mysqli_error($connection);
    }
}


# In add to cart
method 1:
- after adding product to cart, it will not substract from total quantity store in stocks
after customer will buy it then it substract from total stocks

method 2:
- after Add to cart, for 30min it will substract from total stocks(it will give 30 min time to 
customer to purchase the item) then automatically(using trigger) it will back to total quantity.

# MySQL, update multiple tables with one query
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4361774/mysql-update-multiple-tables-with-one-query

Take the case of two tables, Books and Orders. In case, we increase the number of books in a particular order with Order.ID = 1002 in Orders table then we also need to reduce that the total number of books available in our stock by the same number in Books table.

UPDATE Books, Orders
SET Orders.Quantity = Orders.Quantity + 2,
    Books.InStock = Books.InStock - 2
WHERE
    Books.BookID = Orders.BookID
    AND Orders.OrderID = 1002;

# Product Cancel Possiablity
1. When user buy product and Cancel it within hours (change his mind)
    a. if (product is in COD) then ______
    b. if he/she pays online then ______

Solution : To avoid the above case, User(customer) can Cancel it only at doorsteps(ie. after reciveing it) - Not good practice

level: complex
2. When User Buy Product and Want to exchange it with different COLOR or Size
        (Total Amount he paid for the product) + or - (new product) = Final Amount

3. When User Buy Product and Want Money back from website. (REFUND AMOUNT)

 ========================   ChatGPT  =========================
 There are several possible cases of product returns in an e-commerce website, including:

1. Wrong item delivered: If the customer receives a product that is different from what they ordered, they may return it for the correct item.

2. Damaged or defective product: If the product is received in a damaged or defective condition, the customer may return it for a refund or a replacement.

3. Size or fit issues: If the size or fit of the product is not suitable for the customer, they may return it for a different size or a refund.

4. Change of mind: If the customer changes their mind about the purchase, they may return the product for a refund or exchange, subject to the seller's return policy.

5. Late delivery: If the product is not delivered within the promised timeframe, the customer may choose to return it.

6. Fraudulent activity: In rare cases, customers may try to return products that they did not purchase or return items after they have used them.

It is important for e-commerce websites to have clear and transparent return policies that address these various scenarios to ensure customer satisfaction and protect the interests of the seller as well.
